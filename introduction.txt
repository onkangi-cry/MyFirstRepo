## Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Anderson Orangi. I am passionate about software engineering, research, and innovation for Africa’s future. I have taken part in key programs such as the President’s Climate Challenge, and I am a member of Data Innovators and Journalism clubs to enhance my skills.

I’m particularly interested in climate tech and how tools like GitHub can support collaborative, impactful innovation across disciplines.
